# LS Unique theme DevLuan README

I'm always updating the theme.
Every time I'm working and studying and I see a color that would look better or isn't the right color, I update and go up to the platform.

Thanks in advance for the comments

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
